- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, i am @tothaval

these are my repositories. i started programming in jan 2022, and am mainly experienced in c# and wpf.

i recently looked into mvvm pattern for c#/wpf. my main projects are experimental uis designed to speed
up project work of any kind, while aiming at boosting creativity. they are single client applications,
maybe one day they can be connected to each other or a server, but right now they all save and load files
to the local hdd.

it is still a long road to accomplish any of the goals. contact me if you want to join.

right now i am planning and working on basic eboard concepts. since i intend on using mvvm for eboard, i have to change some of
the working solutions of AEUI, which requires some thinking and testing of my intermediate approaches. right now i have a build
that successfully saves and loads EBoards within eboard app, also some eboard config data, as well as the prototype elements.
they can be loaded as well, but since i intend to use shapes and user controls alike, some work is required to design the
loading procedure in a way, that is nicely scalable, extendable to any element content and simple as well. my current approach
centres around some interfaces that help channel data types to two types of manager classes, while the implementation offers a
load and a save function. 

the other applications are useful tools, that help manage a budget in a simple fashion or calculate rent costs for shared
living situations or offices. both are unfinished, but do work to some extend.
